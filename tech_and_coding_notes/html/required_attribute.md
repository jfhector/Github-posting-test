# HTML `required` attribute

The HTML 5 required attribute sounds the same to screen reader users — they hear "required" after the input's label — but the HTML 5 attribute adds a browser behavior (in browsers that support it): it prevents users from submitting the form if there are errors. That can be a good thing in theory, but not all browsers support it, and this takes away some of your freedom to design the error handling behavior, so use this one very cautiously. Also: it's invisible; sighted users can't see it.
