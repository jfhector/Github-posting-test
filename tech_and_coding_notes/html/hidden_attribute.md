### Elements that are descendants of a hidden element are still active

Elements that are descendants of a hidden element are still active, which means that script elements can still execute and form elements can still submit. Elements and scripts may, however, refer to elements that are hidden in other contexts.

This is why the Tenon UI Disclosure.Target component, when it hides using the `hidden` attribute, does it by setting hidden on all the direct children DOM elements. (But is that sufficient? What about further descendants?).

```jsx

/**
 * @component
 * This component is to be used as a child of the Disclosure component.
 * It contains the content that should be hidden / shown on toggle.
 *
 * The component can contain any number of children. All will be toggled
 * safely.
 *
 * @prop {boolean, string} useHidden - Indicates if the hiding should be
 * done with CSS instead of removal / reinsertion into the DOM.
 * @prop {boolean} deactivate - Deactivate the hide / show of the content.
 * Useful in a small number of cases, for example when the Targets are
 * rendered with an Array.map and the first target should always show.

const Target = ({ children, useHidden, deactivate }) => (
    <DisclosureContext.Consumer>
        {({ expanded, globalHidden }) => {
            const isExpanded = globalHidden ? false : expanded;
            return useHidden === true || useHidden === 'true'
                ? Children.map(children, child =>
                      cloneElement(child, {
                          hidden: isExpanded || deactivate ? null : 'hidden'
                      })
                  )
                : isExpanded || deactivate
                ? children
                : null;
        }}
    </DisclosureContext.Consumer>
);

    useHidden: PropTypes.oneOfType([
        PropTypes.bool,

export default Target;
