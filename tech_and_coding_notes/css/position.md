# The `position` property

## Sticky

##Â Why isn't my sticky element not sticking?

A sticky element on sticks in so far as it can stay within its parent html element.

I.e. it needs space, within this component, to move to stay within it as well as sticking.
If it doesn't have space, it will follow the component rather than stick.

## What causes a sticky component to break its sticking position?

A sticky element breaks its sticking position when it has to in order to stay within its parent component (which is typically static, and hence scrolling).
