# Grid - automatic placement

* Why isn't using [Grid with repeat autofit and auto in minmax](./../../code_examples/2019Q4/0906-Q-Grid-using-auto-in-minmax/README.md) not lining up boxes in a row? (Grid with repeat autofit and 200px in minmax does).
  * <code>auto</code> doesn't seem to be an accepted value for <code>minmax</code>... ? It's not used on the MDN page.
