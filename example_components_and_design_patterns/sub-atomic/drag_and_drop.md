# Drag and drop

You cannot rely on drag and drop features for critical operations on touch devices, because while some touch devices allow drag and drop operations, not all do. Even on those that do support drag and drop operations, there are differences in how that kind of functionality would need to be implemented across different operating systems and versions of operating systems, making the script somewhat fragile and unreliable. If you create drag and drop functionality, think of it as an optional enhancement to supplement the main fully-featured click functionality.
