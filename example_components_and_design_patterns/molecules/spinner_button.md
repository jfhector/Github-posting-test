# Spinner Button

## Summary

## Master implementation: my own based on TenonUI, with some improvements

See [implementation](./../../code_examples/2019Q4/1015TUI-SpinnerButton/README.md).

### Testing status

Tested in MacOS Safari + Chrome + Vo, and NVDA + Chrome

* The component receives a `isBusy` prop. But this prop doesn't directly, immediately trigger rendering of the Spinner. What does is its `isSpinning` boolean state.
  * 100ms after `isBusy` becomes true, `isSpinning` becomes true. And conversely for false. This is to introduce throttling and avoid having more than 3 flashes per second.

* The component receives `busyAnnouncement` and `completeAnnouncement` props (with defaults set in the component. These provide the content of the announcements of a live (`role='status'`) region.
* What triggers the announcement, is a `liveAnnouncement` string piece of state that populates the live region, and gets updated.
* `liveAnnouncement` gets updated with `busyAnnouncement`, `completeAnnouncement` or `''` depending on the changes of the `isBusy` prop, but following a algorithm so that:
  * `liveAnnouncement` always gets cleared before it gets repopulated again, 100ms later
  * any scheduled clearing and repopulating of `liveAnnouncement` gets cancelled if whenever the next ones are getting scheduled (before `isBusy` has changed again, for example)
  * the content of `liveAnnouncement` gets cleared 500ms after being populated, to not polute the DOM

For more details on how this is done, see the example page and related notes.

####Â Styling it

```css
.SpinnerButton {
  background-color: blue;
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  appearance: none;
  border: none;
  padding: 1rem 1.2rem;
  margin: 1rem;
  color: white;
  border-radius: 0.3rem;
}

.SpinnerButton__spinner {
  width: 1.5rem; /* It's only once I had set a width on the svg element that it displayed to the right on the text content */
  height: 1.5rem;
  color: white;
  vertical-align: middle;
  margin-left: 0.8rem;
  margin-top: -0.8rem;
  margin-bottom: -0.8rem; /* I'm using negative margins because the spinner is taller than the text. And I don't want the height of the button to increase*/
}
```
