# WTF Forms examples

## Backlog

###Â Checkbox

* Disabled styles
* Third state

### Select

* Visible label
* WHCM-friendly arrow
* Better-looking arrow

### Radio group

* NDVA says 'one of one' on each option. Is there a way to be more explicit, so that NVDA understands that it's a list of two items?
  * e.g. put radio items in a list?
  * e.g. use `aria-` attributes?

### Progress

I haven't managed to read the progress bars with JAWS and Chrome
