# Support for the `placeholder` attribute

Screen reader support for placeholder text has improved and all major screen readers read the placeholder text as a field label when the text field is empty. 

Once text has been entered, results vary among screen readers. At this time, both NVDA and JAWS read placeholder text as the field label even when text has been entered in the field. VoiceOver, however, does not read the placeholder text as a label after text has been entered.
