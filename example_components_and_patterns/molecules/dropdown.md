* [2019Q4 0904 Dropdown in sass](./../../code_examples/2019Q4/0904-Dropdown-in-sass/README.md)
  * I can size a dropdown drawer in relation to the dropdown toggle, indirectly, by sizing it in relation to their common parent.

  * Positioned elements (e.g. `position: absolute`, `relative`) are painted on a different layer, above static elements. By default (i.e. if `z-index` hasn't been used to modified this), their order within positioned elements on the z axis comes from the source order.
