# CSS-generated content

## CSS-generated informative content SHOULD be avoided unless the same information is available to screen reader users in another, equivalent way

CSS-generated content is supported by NVDA + Firefox, VoiceOver on OS X + Safari, and VoiceOver on iOS + Safari. 

It is not supported by JAWS + Internet Explorer or by Narrator + Edge. Given the lack of universal support, it is best to avoid CSS-generated content, especially if that content is meaningful and not just for decoration.
